# Difficulties
- I had problems starting the practical work because I did not practice with the activity iv.
- Problems with making the commits and the puses in GitBash.
- Problems making the structure of each page.


# Conclusions
My conclusions of this practical work II can be summed up in the difficulty due to the time used to do it as I thought this would be fast to do but I got surprised when I had spent some days and really long hours working on it. 
To make a good work is essential to have made the previous activities as you have to apply all of the knowledge acquired during the semester.
To add, this is a good practice to make us use all our knowledge in html, css and GitHub.
